# 🟦 Stop war on Ukraine 🟨

As a libertarian and programmer, I would never think that I would someday work on a piece of software that would go against free access to any service from any corner of the world.

But unfortunately, the situation has changed.

Ukraine was attacked by Russia and a lot of innocent children, women and men are now dying in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities at the hands of one cruel dictator.

**This can not be tolerated in 21. century in Europe.**

We can not just close our eyes and just provide all services and benefits to the Russian economy which can keep killing innocent people.

**If you are managing some website, please stop it for Russia** until the war will be over and putin overthrown.

---

I have created a simple way how to do it.

If the users are from other places, nothing happens. The script is tiny to load. If the visitor is from Russia or Belarus (detected by system language) this message will appear:

## 📲 How to include on your page?

There are several ways how to add this to your page:

### 📔 Via HTML script tag

<!--!!! Add here latest immutable version-->

```html
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hejny/Ukraine/main/dist/umd/main.js"></script>
<script>
    Ukraine.create();
</script>
```

_Note:_ You can [also modify the options](https://github.com/hejny/Ukraine/blob/main/samples/browser.html#L10).
_Note: Normally you would include **async** and **defer** keywords in the script element. But in this situation we do not want to defer this miniscript._

<!--
TODO:

### 📘 Import into the bundle

```

```typescript
