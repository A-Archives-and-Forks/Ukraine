# 🟦 Stop war on Ukraine 🟨

As a libertarian and programmer, I would never think that I would someday work on a piece of software that would go against free access to any service from any corner of the world.

But unfortunately, the situation has changed.

Ukraine was attacked by Russia and a lot of innocent children, women and men are now dying in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities at the hands of one cruel dictator.

**This can not be tolerated in 21. century in Europe.**

We can not just close our eyes and just provide all services and benefits to the Russian economy which can keep killing innocent people.

**If you are managing some website, please stop it for Russia** until the war will be over and putin overthrown.

---

I don't want to punish the Russian people as a whole. A lot of them do not support the politics of their state. But unfortunately, economic pressure is now one of the less bad solutions.

---

I have created a simple way how to do it.

For the users **from other places, nothing happens**. The script is tiny to load and insignificant. If the visitor is from **Russia or Belarus** _(detected by system language)_ this **message will appear**:

## 📲 How to include on your page?

There are several ways how to add this to your page:

### 📔 Via HTML script tag

<!-- TODO: Auto update of version v0.13.0 -->

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/save-ukraine@0.13.0/dist/umd/main.js"></script>
<script>
    Ukraine.save();
</script>
```

_Note:_ You can [also modify the options](https://github.com/hejny/Ukraine/blob/main/samples/browser.html#L10).
_Note: Normally you would include **async** and **defer** keywords in the script element. But in this situation we do not want to defer this miniscript._

### 📘 Import into the bundle

First, you need to install [save-ukraine package from NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/save-ukraine):

```bash
npm i save-ukraine
```

And then use:

```typescript
import Ukraine from 'save-ukraine';

Ukraine.save();
```

_Note: This library is written in TypeScript so [options](./src/options.ts) are fully typed._

### 👨🏽‍💻 Security
